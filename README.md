# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with YOLOv8 and Streamlit

This repository is a comprehensive open-source project that demonstrates the integration of object detection and tracking using the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm and Streamlit, a popular Python web application framework for building interactive web applications. This project provides a user-friendly and customizable interface that can detect and track objects in real-time video streams.
